# roboPrice

This is a project I made that sums prices of specific catagories together.

You can see a live version here:

The hardest thing about this project was actually the front end. I am not
used to how web front ends work at all, so all the back end data-wrangling
in PHP took less than an hour, while figuring out a "decent" front end
was the hard part for me.

Hope that you like it!
